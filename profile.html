      The Black Mesa Research Facility (also simply called Black Mesa) is a
      fictional underground laboratory complex that serves as the primary
      setting for the video game Half-Life and its expansions, as well as its
      unofficial remake, Black Mesa. It also features in the wider Half-Life
      universe, including the Portal series. Located in the New Mexico desert in
      a decommissioned Cold War missile site, it is the former employer of
      Half-Life's theoretical physicist protagonist, Gordon Freeman, and a
      competitor of Aperture Science. While the facility ostensibly conducts
      military-industrial research, its secret experiments into teleportation
      have caused it to make contact with the alien world of Xen, and its
      scientists covertly study its life-forms and materials. In a catastrophic
      event known as the "Black Mesa Incident", an "anti-mass spectrometer"
      experiment conducted on Xen matter causes a Resonance Cascade disaster
      that allows aliens to invade Earth, and is the catalyst for the events of
      the series.
